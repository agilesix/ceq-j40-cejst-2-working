            Version 2.0 Release update - Dec 19, 2024

            New & Improved
          </div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Added the low income burden to American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin
        Islands
              </li>
              <li>
                Tracts in these territories that are completely surrounded by disadvantaged tracts and exceed
        an adjusted low income threshold are now considered disadvantaged
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, census tracts in these four Territories are now considered disadvantaged if they
        meet the low income threshold only, because these Territories are not included in the nationally-consistent
        datasets on environmental and climate burdens used in the tool
              </li>
              <li>
                Updated the data in the workforce development category to the Census Decennial 2020 data for
        the U.S. territories of Guam, Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa
              </li>
              <li>
                Made improvements to the low income burden to better identify college students before they are
        excluded from that burdenâ€™s percentile
              </li>
              <li>
                Census tracts that were disadvantaged under version 1.0 continue to be considered as
        disadvantaged in version 2.0
              </li>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For tracts that have water boundaries, e.g. coastal or island tracts, the water boundaries are
        now excluded from the calculation to determine if a tract is 100% surrounded by disadvantaged census tracts

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Added the ability to search by census tract ID
              </li>
              <li>
                The basemap has been updated to use a free, open source map
